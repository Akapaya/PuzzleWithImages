# Projeto Unity: Puzzle with images

Welcome to my Unity repository, where I share my project developed as part of learning and knowledge, this project will still be updated using AI generating the images for the game.

## Project description

### Puzzle with images
It has a menu for selecting images, and a menu for the gallery, which unlocks images depending on which have been previously assembled.

The selected image is cut into 4 rows and 5 columns, the player swaps the pieces by clicking on two pieces.
